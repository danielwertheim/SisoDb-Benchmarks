# Some benchmarks for SisoDb and RavenDb

This project was the result of this post: http://daniel.wertheim.se/2012/03/11/ranting-is-good-for-you/

It's just some tests with SisoDb and RavenDb that probably is far from reality. I probably have missused RavenDb since I don't know that product, e.g by not using correct query and setting up a static index etc. (Puh!)
